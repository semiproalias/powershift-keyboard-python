Binds Caps key as a "hypershift" to move other keys to your home row. 

I created this because I was tired of my hands having to leave the home row to 
navigate documents (resumes, code, etc.) The mappings are loosely based on the
Nethack key config used when the keyboard does not have a numpad.

I originally implemented this functionality in an AHK script for Windows. 
I currently use it through built-in functionality in the drivers of a a new 
keyboard brand I switched to due to the plesantness of their membranes.
That is the best experience I've had with this by far. 
This script I wrote in Python to get this functionality into the hands of a 
deserving friend who does not use the same brand of keyboard or OS.

MAPPINGS:

A - Capslock (e.g. Caps+A toggles Capslock)

Bkspc - Delete (e.g. Caps+Backspace is the same as pressing Del key)

Arrows - Same as Nethack:
J - Left
; - Right
K - Up
L - Down

Home/End:
I - Home
O - Out

Page Up/Down - Same as Nethack:
< - Page Up
> - Page Down

NOTES:

Ctrl:
These all work with Ctrl+ as well, e.g. Caps+Ctrl+I will produce the same result as Ctrl+Home

Right-Alt:
For convenience, Right-Alt is set up as a shortcut for Ctrl when you are using Caps, e.g.:
Caps+Right-Alt+I will produce same result as Caps+Ctrl+I as in Ctrl+Home

Shift:
Not yet implemented due to issue in Keyboard library (Issue #330 on GitHub)

Main() & While Loop:
I believe these are only necessary if executing the script in the debugger so the hooks are 
help open. If run from the CLI, only the hotkeys should be required.
