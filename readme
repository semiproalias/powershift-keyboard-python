This script saves time and makes life easier if you're frequently editing
text & documents (resumes, CVs, code, scripts, etc.) in software like Word,
Notepad, VS Code, Visual Studio, etc.

How it Works:
Capslock becomes the PowerShift key. Holding it changes the functionality of 
other keys. Caps is used because it is infrequently used for its intended 
purpose, which can be easily accessed anyway by pressing Caps+A. 

The goal is to get navigation to your fingertips efficiently. The Arrow Keys,
Page Up, Page Down, Home, and End are all accessible with your right hand.
The all-powerful Control+Arrows, Control+Home, and Control+End are also 
immediately accessible, by simply pressing Ctrl+Caps+[keys] or, to avoid
uncomfortable contortions, Caps+Right-Alt+[Keys]. That's right, when Power-
Shifted, the right-alt key becomes a control key to make it easier to quickly
navigate your document.

The PowerShift functionality is also referred to as function-shifting, 
hypershifting (Razer), g-shifting (Logitech), etc.

The mappings are loosely based on the Nethack key config. The easiest way to
learn them is to draw it on a sticky note and use it very basic. Start with just
Up, Down, Page Up, Page Down, Home, End. They can be seen in two columns of keys,
all pressed by your middle and ring finger. Middle finger goes up, Ring finger 
goes down. Easy!

Known Issues: 
Shift & Alt functionality are limited in Windows 10 due to issues
with the Keyboard library (Issues #330 & #332). Suggest trying in Linux; just 
un-comment the relevant commented lines in the script. For Win users, the AHK
script will be uploaded soon and is a better alternative imo.

Bottom Line: 
Still worth using this script if you don't have something similar
already in place, as the immediate access to basic and ctrl+arrow keys, page up/
page down, home/end, and delete will result in huge time savings throughout the
year if you're a frequent editor of documents.

MAPPINGS:

A - Capslock (e.g. Caps+A toggles Capslock)

Bkspc - Delete (e.g. Caps+Backspace is the same as pressing Del key)

Arrows - Same as Nethack:
J - Left
; - Right
K - Up
L - Down

Home/End:
I - Home
O - Out

Page Up/Down - Same as Nethack:
< - Page Up
> - Page Down


NOTES:

Ctrl:
These all work with Ctrl+ as well, e.g. Caps+Ctrl+I will produce the same result as Ctrl+Home

Right-Alt as Ctrl when PowerShifted:
For convenience, Right-Alt is set up as a shortcut for Ctrl when you are using Caps, e.g.:
Caps+Right-Alt+I will produce same result as Caps+Ctrl+I as in Ctrl+Home

Shift Functionality:
Not yet implemented due to issue in Keyboard library (Issue #330 on GitHub)

Alt+Shift Functionality:
Related to above. Alt+Shift+Up/Down clones a line in VS Code. Also very handy, but not 
yet implemented due to Issue #330/331 in pythong Keybard library.

Left-Alt:
Works as alt, as in Alt+Up/Down to move a line of text up or down in Word or VS Code... Handy!

Superfluous Main() and __Name__ Checks:
I believe these are only necessary if executing the script in the debugger, so the hooks 
are held open. If running from the CLI, Main() should not be required.

BACKSTORY:

I created this because I was tired of removing my hands from the home row whilst 
navigating resumes (as an agency recruiter, I navigated a _lot_ of resumes).
I originally implemented the functionality in an AHK script for Windows. I later
started using the Razer Ornata keyboard due to the supreme pleasantness of their  
mechamembranes, and found that the Hypershift functionality in their Synapse drivers 
provides a much more seamless experience in Win10. So, that's what I recommend if you're 
working in a fixed location. However, I still use the script while working 
directly on the laptop keyboard and will get around to posting it on GitHub at
some point because I like it better.

This feature set is also very handy navigating code, which is how this script came to 
be in Python. I mentioned to a friend how much nicer it is to press CAPS+O to reach
end-of-line than it is to move a hand to arrows/end/etc. He liked the idea a lot, but 
he's not working in Windows and he's not using my brand. As a professional data scientist
at one of the world's leading megacorps, I thought I'd do him a solid and have a little 
fun re-forging it in Python.
